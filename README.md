![Civic Issue Tracker Hero Image](https://placehold.co/1200x630/6366f1/ffffff/png?text=Civic%20Issue%20Tracker)

**A modern, AI-powered web application that allows citizens to report, track, and view resolutions of civic issues in their neighborhood.**

This project was built to address the common challenge of inefficient and opaque civic issue reporting. By leveraging modern web technologies and the power of generative AI, this platform streamlines the process from submission to resolution, fostering transparency and community engagement.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### For Citizens
*   **AI-Powered Reporting**: Describe an issue, and our **Google Gemini** integration automatically suggests a concise title and categorizes it (e.g., Pothole, Graffiti, Streetlight).
*   **Photo Uploads**: Attach a photo of the issue for clear visual context.
*   **Interactive Map Location**: Pinpoint the exact location of the issue using an interactive **Google Map** with address search functionality.
*   **Real-time Status Tracking**: View a personal dashboard of all your reported issues and track their status from `Pending` to `Resolved`.
*   **Commenting & Interaction**: Communicate with admins or workers by adding comments to your issue reports.
*   **Confirm Resolution & Rate Service**: Once work is marked as complete, citizens can confirm the resolution and provide a 1-5 star rating, creating a feedback loop.

### For Admins & Workers
*   **Role-Based Access Control**: A sophisticated system with four distinct user roles: `Citizen`, `Worker`, `Admin`, and `Service`.
*   **Admin Dashboard**: A comprehensive view of all reported issues. Admins can update issue statuses, manage assignments, and oversee the entire system.
*   **Worker Dashboard**: Workers see a personalized view of only the issues assigned to them, helping them focus on their tasks.
*   **Automated Issue Assignment**: New issues are automatically assigned to the nearest available worker based on their registered location.
*   **User Management**: Admins can create new users (Workers, Service), manage user roles, and set worker locations directly on a map.

### Platform Features
*   **Public Transparency Dashboard**: The landing page showcases recently resolved issues, providing transparency to the public on the platform's effectiveness.
*   **Secure Authentication**: A complete login and registration system.
*   **Fully Responsive Design**: A clean, modern UI built with Tailwind CSS that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Mock Backend**: Utilizes browser `localStorage` to provide a fully functional, persistent experience without needing a live backend‚Äîperfect for a hackathon.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

*   **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
*   **Generative AI**: Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`) for AI-powered issue categorization and title generation.
*   **Maps & Geolocation**: Google Maps Platform
    *   **Maps JavaScript API**: For interactive map modals and static map previews.
    *   **Geocoding API**: For converting search queries into coordinates.
*   **Backend Simulation**: Browser `localStorage` to mock a persistent database for users and issues.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
*   Access to the project files.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/civic-issue-tracker.git
    cd civic-issue-tracker
    ```

2.  **Configure API Keys**
    This project requires two API keys from Google.

    *   **Google Gemini API Key**:
        1.  Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
        2.  This project is set up to read the key from an environment variable (`process.env.API_KEY`) which is typically configured in the hosting environment.

    *   **Google Maps Platform API Key**:
        1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project.
        2.  Enable the following two (2) APIs for your project:
            *   **Maps JavaScript API**
            *   **Geocoding API**
        3.  Create a new API Key under "Credentials".
        4.  **Important**: For security, restrict your API key!
            *   Under "Application restrictions," select "Websites" and add the URLs where you will host the app (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`, `*.your-domain.com`).
            *   Under "API restrictions," select "Restrict key" and choose only the **Maps JavaScript API** and **Geocoding API**.
        5.  Open the `index.html` file and replace the placeholder `google_api_key` with your actual Google Maps API key:
            ```html
            <!-- in index.html -->
            <script src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY&libraries=marker"></script>
            ```

3.  **Run the Application**
    Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You can use a simple web server or a live server extension in your code editor for the best experience.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

This project provides a strong foundation. Here are some potential next steps:

*   **Chatbot for Status Updates**: Implement the hackathon's bonus idea by adding a Gemini-powered chatbot where users can ask, "What's the status of my complaint?"
*   **Notifications**: Integrate push or email notifications for real-time status updates.
*   **Full Backend Implementation**: Replace the `localStorage` mock API with a real backend service (e.g., Node.js/Express, Firebase, or Supabase) for a production-ready application.
*   **Analytics Dashboard**: Provide admins with analytics on issue types, resolution times, and worker performance.
