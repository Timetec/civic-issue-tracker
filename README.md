## ‚ú® Key Features

This application provides a role-based experience tailored to Citizens, Admins, and Workers.

### For Citizens
*   **AI-Powered Issue Reporting**: Describe an issue, upload photos, and pinpoint the location on a map. Our Google Gemini integration automatically suggests a concise title and categorizes the report (e.g., Pothole, Graffiti, Streetlight).
*   **Interactive Map**: Use an interactive Google Map to precisely place your issue report. You can use your device's current location or search for an address.
*   **Personal Dashboard**: View all your reported issues in a clean, card-based layout. Track their status from 'Pending' to 'Resolved'.
*   **Filter & Search**: Easily filter your reports by status or search for a specific issue by its unique ID.
*   **Dual View Modes**: Toggle between a standard list view and an interactive map view that shows all unresolved issues in your area, including your own location.
*   **Detailed Issue Tracking**: Click on any issue to see a full detail view, including all comments, photos, and status history.
*   **Confirm & Rate**: Once a worker marks an issue as complete, you can confirm the resolution and provide a 1-5 star rating to give feedback on the service.
*   **Direct Communication**: Add comments to your issue reports to communicate directly with the assigned worker or an administrator.
*   **AI Chatbot Assistant**: A friendly chatbot is available to quickly check the status of any of your reported issues by simply providing the issue ID.

### For Admins
*   **Comprehensive Admin Dashboard**: Get a complete overview of all issues reported across the platform.
*   **Full Issue Control**: Update the status of any issue (e.g., mark as 'In Progress') or re-assign it to a different worker at any time.
*   **User Management**: Access a dedicated page to view all registered users and their roles.
*   **Create New Users**: Onboard new 'Worker' or 'Service' level users. When creating a worker, you can set their default location on a map to optimize automatic assignments.

### For Workers
*   **Personalized Work Queue**: The worker dashboard shows a filtered list of only the issues that are currently assigned to you.
*   **Task Management**: Update the status of your assigned issues as you work on them, from 'In Progress' to 'For Review' when the job is done.
*   **Location Management**: Update your own work location in your profile. This location is used by the system to automatically assign you the nearest new reports.

### Platform Features
*   **Secure Authentication**: A complete login and registration system for all user roles.
*   **Role-Based Access**: The UI and available actions dynamically change based on whether you are a Citizen, Worker, or Admin.
*   **Fully Responsive Design**: A clean, modern UI built with Tailwind CSS that works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Backend Abstraction Layer**: Architected to seamlessly switch between a local `localStorage` mock backend and a live remote backend by changing a single environment variable.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm) installed on your machine.
*   A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/civic-issue-tracker.git
    cd civic-issue-tracker
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API Keys & Environment**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to store your configuration.

    *   Create the file:
        ```sh
        touch .env
        ```
    *   Add the following content to your new `.env` file, replacing the placeholders with your actual keys. **Only include the variables you need for your setup.**

        ```env
        # --- REQUIRED FOR MOCK/LOCAL DEVELOPMENT ---
        # Used for the client-side Gemini calls in the mock API.
        VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
        
        # --- REQUIRED FOR BOTH MODES ---
        # Used for Google Maps integration.
        VITE_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY

        # --- OPTIONAL: FOR CONNECTING TO A REAL BACKEND ---
        # If this URL is present, the app will make live API calls instead of using the mock.
        VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5000 
        ```

    *   **To get your keys:**
        *   **Google Gemini API Key**: Obtain an API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
            *   **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTE:** When you create your Gemini API key in the Google Cloud Console, you will see security restriction options.
            *   **For Backend Use (Recommended):** If you are running the Gemini calls on your backend server (by setting `VITE_API_BASE_URL`), your Gemini API key **MUST NOT** have "Website restrictions" (HTTP referrer restrictions). Server-to-server requests do not have a browser "referer" and will be blocked, resulting in a `403 API_KEY_HTTP_REFERRER_BLOCKED` error. Instead, leave the key unrestricted or use IP address restrictions if applicable.
            *   **For Frontend Mock Use:** If you are only using the mock API (client-side calls), you **SHOULD** add "Website restrictions" to your key, listing your development URL (e.g., `localhost:5173`) and deployment URL (e.g., `your-app-name.vercel.app`).

        *   **Google Maps Platform API Key**:
            1.  Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project.
            2.  Enable the following three (3) APIs for your project:
                *   **Maps JavaScript API**
                *   **Geocoding API**
                *   **Maps Static API**
            3.  Create a new API Key under "Credentials".
            4.  **Important**: For security, restrict your Maps API key to your development and production domains using "Website restrictions".

4.  **Run the Application**
    Start the local development server:
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is busy). By default, it will run using the mock `localStorage` backend.

## üîå Connecting to a Real Backend

This application is designed to connect to any backend that adheres to the defined API contract below. To switch from the mock `localStorage` mode to a live backend:

1.  **Set the Environment Variable**: Add `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your `.env` file and set it to the URL of your running backend server (e.g., `http://localhost:5000` for a local Flask server, or your deployed API URL).
2.  **Restart the Development Server**: Stop and restart `npm run dev` for the new environment variable to be loaded.
3.  **Secure Gemini API Key**: When using a real backend, the `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` is no longer needed on the frontend. The backend server should handle all calls to the Gemini API. You should move the API key to your backend server's environment variables for security.

### API Contract for Backend Implementation

Your backend server (e.g., Python/Flask) must implement the following RESTful endpoints. Authentication is handled via Bearer Tokens (JWT).

#### Authentication (`/api/auth`)
*   `POST /api/auth/register`
    *   **Body**: `{ email, password, firstName, lastName, mobileNumber }`
    *   **Response**: `{ token: "jwt_token", user: { ...userObject } }`
*   `POST /api/auth/login`
    *   **Body**: `{ email, password }`
    *   **Response**: `{ token: "jwt_token", user: { ...userObject } }`

#### Users (`/api/users`)
*   `GET /api/users` (Admin only)
    *   **Response**: `[ { ...userObject }, ... ]`
*   `POST /api/users` (Admin only)
    *   **Body**: `{ email, password, firstName, lastName, mobileNumber, role, location? }`
    *   **Response**: `{ ...userObject }`
*   `GET /api/users/me` (Authenticated users)
    *   **Response**: `{ ...userObject }`
*   `PUT /api/users/me` (Authenticated users)
    *   **Body**: `{ firstName, lastName, mobileNumber }`
    *   **Response**: `{ ...userObject }`
*   `PUT /api/users/me/password` (Authenticated users)
    *   **Body**: `{ oldPassword, newPassword }`
    *   **Response**: `200 OK`
*   `PUT /api/users/me/location` (Authenticated users, mainly for Workers)
    *   **Body**: `{ lat, lng }`
    *   **Response**: `{ ...userObject }`

#### Issues (`/api/issues`)
*   `GET /api/issues` (Admin only)
    *   **Response**: `[ { ...issueObject }, ... ]`
*   `GET /api/issues/reported` (Citizen only)
    *   Returns issues reported by the authenticated citizen.
    *   **Response**: `[ { ...issueObject }, ... ]`
*   `GET /api/issues/assigned` (Worker only)
    *   Returns issues assigned to the authenticated worker.
    *   **Response**: `[ { ...issueObject }, ... ]`
*   `GET /api/issues/user/:identifier` (Service role only)
    *   Returns issues for a specific user by email or mobile.
    *   **Response**: `[ { ...issueObject }, ... ]`
*   `GET /api/issues/:id` (Authenticated users, with role-based access checks)
    *   **Response**: `{ ...issueObject }`
*   `POST /api/issues` (Authenticated users)
    *   **Body**: `FormData` containing `description` (string), `location` (JSON string `{"lat": number, "lng": number}`), and `photos` (file array).
    *   **Backend Logic**: The backend should receive this, call the Gemini API for categorization, find the nearest worker, and then create the issue in the database.
    *   **Response**: `{ ...issueObject }`
*   `POST /api/issues/:id/comments` (Authorized users)
    *   **Body**: `{ text: "comment_text" }`
    *   **Response**: `{ ...issueObject }`
*   `PUT /api/issues/:id/status` (Admin/Worker only)
    *   **Body**: `{ status: "NewStatus" }`
    *   **Response**: `{ ...issueObject }`
*   `PUT /api/issues/:id/assign` (Admin only)
    *   **Body**: `{ workerEmail: "worker@test.com" }`
    *   **Response**: `{ ...issueObject }`
*   `PUT /api/issues/:id/resolve` (Citizen who reported it only)
    *   **Body**: `{ rating: 5 }`
    *   **Response**: `{ ...issueObject }`
